# Advent of Code 

Who ? 

I'm a curious data scientist. I like math and problem solving.

Why ? 

In January 2025, I decided to step back from all the noise caused by AI to learn the fundamentals of computer science. I think it's essential in order to stay competitive. I cannot afford to stay mediocre. 

I started reading thoroughly about computer architectures. In order to keep improving my understanding, I need in parallel to learn programming. So I decided to use advent of code challenges as a way to learn languages (each year one language) and programming (which means learning problem solving, data structures and algorithms). 

How ?

The idea to master computer science and programming is to learn about it by "doing". I'd like to start this journey with low level languages for the first years to high level and domain specific languages at the end. I'll try to capture different paradigm, structures of data and basic algortithms. This are essential to go deeply to understand computer architecture. 
This README file will track my progression and also the subject and things that I'm struggling with in order to work on it more.
